### TON Subdomain marketplacy by DEVDAO

### Shareholders
DevDao (10%)
Victor (30%) â€” Unique smartcontract (DEP-1) for selling subdomains
Maksim (25%) - Front-end development.
Nick (20%) - Design.
Kirill (15%) - Product owner (PO).


### Idea
Make a market, where any wallet can put their domain to sale subdomains and any user can buy subdomain with any domain.

### Domain sharing
We take 80% of subdomain sold price.
20% moving to domain owner.

### Iteration #1
Marketplace of our own domains.

### Iteration #2
Page for adding domain to our marketplace.

### Iteration #3
Catalog of sold domains. (NFT collection viewer)

### Frontend
Page with input for subdomain and switching domain. (Iteration #1)
Show to user is subdomain taken or not. (Iteration #1)
Show to user suggestions. (Iteration #1)
Page with information how to put domain to sale. (Iteration #2)
Show catalog of sold domains. (Iteration #3)

### Smartcontract (SMC)
When funds coming to SMC balance, we need to create subdomain with name from comment, if it is accesible, else we need to send funds back to owner.
If TONs was transferred to inactive subdomain, this funds will be locked on smartcontract.
Image and name of subdomain should get own metadata with DEVDAO branding.
